# Task 1: Telemetry Data Analysis in Tableau

This repository contains my solution for Task 1. The goal of this task was to analyze telemetry data from Daikibo's factories and answer two business-critical questions using Tableau.

## Background Information
Daikibo, an industrial manufacturing company, collected telemetry data from four factories worldwide:
- Factory Meiyo (Tokyo, Japan)
- Factory Seiko (Osaka, Japan)
- Daikibo Berlin (Berlin, Germany)
- Daikibo Shenzhen (Shenzhen, China)

Each factory had 9 types of machines, generating telemetry messages every 10 minutes over a one-month period (May 2021)

## Objective
Analyze telemetry data collected from four Daikibo factory locations for the month of May 2021, and answer:
- In which location did machines break the most?
- What are the machines that broke most often in that location?
